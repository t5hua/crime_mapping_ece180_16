Notes:

To run the code, you need to install (python 2.7)
1. numpy
2. uszipcode - pip install uszipcode
3. gmplot - please install from the github repo directly, the pip install will only give you an outdated version.
- pip install git+https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot.git
4. Now the output .html file will be ~100MB, next time is to linearize the crime frequency of each zipcode, so we don't need to draw thousands of points on a single zipcode, but can still reflect their frequency difference.
